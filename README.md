Final Programming Project: Atomic Nature of Matter for COS-126 


The Problem

We have been provided the video microscopy data of polystyrene spheres (beads) suspended in water, undergoing Brownian motion. Our task was to write a program to analyze this data, determine how much each bead moves between observations, fit this data to Einstein’s model, and estimate Avogadro’s number.



biggest challenges you might face :
- implementing DFS in BeadFinder.java
- which data structure to use for the collection of blobs

To run :
java-introcs BeadTracker 25 180.0 25.0 run_1/*.jpg | java-introcs Avogadro
